      <h2>WHITE ISLAND</h2>
      <p>White Island, located off the coast of Mambajao in Camiguin, Philippines, is a natural 
sandbar that has existed for centuries. Unlike other islands, it has no vegetation or permanent 
structures and constantly changes shape depending on tides and weather conditions. Historically, 
it has been a favorite spot for locals and fishermen, serving as a resting point and a scenic 
backdrop to the majestic Mt. Hibok-Hibok. Over time, it became one of Camiguin’s most iconic attractions, 
drawing visitors for its pristine beauty and panoramic views.</p><br>

       <p>White Island is an uninhabited white sandbar about 1.4 kilometers off the northern shore of     
Mambajao, accessible by a short boat ride from Barangay Yumbing or Agoho. The island offers clear 
turquoise waters ideal for swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing. Its shape changes with the 
tide—sometimes forming a crescent, other times a horseshoe. With no shade or facilities, visitors 
are advised to bring sun protection and essentials. From White Island, tourists can enjoy a stunning 
360-degree view of Camiguin, especially the nearby Mt. Hibok-Hibok and Mt. Vulcan.</p>

        <p>The cultural heritage of White Island is deeply rooted in the maritime traditions of Camiguin's 
indigenous people. The local fishing community considers this sandbar a sacred site, believing it to be 
blessed by "Bantay Dagat" (sea guardians). These mystical guardians are said to protect both the waters 
and the fishermen who depend on them. The ever-changing shape of the sandbar is seen as a living symbol 
of nature's power and is treated with great respect by the local community.</p><br>

      <p>Local folklore speaks of White Island's spiritual significance, particularly during special lunar 
phases. During full moons, traditional fishermen perform the "Pangamuyo sa Dagat" (prayer to the sea) 
ritual, offering small gifts of fruits, flowers, and local delicacies to honor the sea spirits. Many 
believe the pristine white sand has healing properties, especially at dawn when the first sunlight 
touches the shore. Elders tell stories of how their ancestors would collect small amounts of sand for 
traditional healing ceremonies.</p><br>

      <p>The waters surrounding White Island are rich with marine life, contributing to the area's unique 
culinary traditions. Local fishermen regularly catch premium fish like "Tangigue" (Spanish mackerel) 
and "Tambakol" (yellowfin tuna). These fresh catches are often prepared as "Kinilaw," a local ceviche 
made with coconut vinegar, native citrus, and aromatic spices. The area is also famous for "Tuyom" 
(sea urchins), considered a delicacy and served fresh with local vinegar.</p><br>

      <p>Traditional fishing families are known for their signature dish "Sinuglaw," which creatively 
combines grilled pork with fresh fish ceviche. The mainland community prepares "Binagol," a unique 
delicacy made from grated talipot palm pith and coconut milk, traditionally served in coconut shells. 
Local seaweed varieties like "lato" (sea grapes) and "guso" are harvested sustainably and prepared 
into refreshing salads with calamansi dressing.</p><br>

      <p>Modern visitors to White Island are encouraged to respect these cultural traditions. Local boat 
operators maintain the custom of offering prayers before departure, and many share stories of the 
island's cultural significance with tourists. This balance of tourism and tradition helps preserve 
the spiritual and cultural heritage of this natural wonder for future generations.</p>
