      <h2> THE ECO PARK</h2>
      <p>The Eco Park of Lebak was established as part of the local government’s initiative 
to promote environmental conservation and sustainable tourism. Originally, the area was a 
simple open space used by the community for small gatherings and recreational activities. 
Over time, it was developed into an eco-friendly park that highlights the natural beauty and 
biodiversity of Lebak, while also serving as a model for ecological awareness and green 
development. The project aimed to create a space where nature and community could thrive 
together, reflecting Lebak’s commitment to preserving its rich natural heritage.</p><br>

       <p>Today, the Eco Park of Lebak serves as a popular destination for both locals and 
tourists who wish to enjoy outdoor leisure and environmental education. The park features 
walking trails, picnic areas, gardens, and spaces for cultural and recreational activities. 
It also promotes eco-friendly practices such as waste segregation, tree planting, and sustainable 
landscaping. Visitors can experience the tranquility of nature while learning about environmental 
stewardship, making it an ideal spot for family outings, school trips, and community events.</p>

       <p>An eco park is a protected natural area designed to promote environmental conservation, sustainable 
tourism, and cultural preservation. It serves as a sanctuary for plants and animals while providing a peaceful 
place for people to relax, learn, and connect with nature. Many eco parks in the Philippines are located in areas 
rich in biodiversity, such as forests, mountains, and lakes. They are developed not only to attract tourists 
but also to encourage environmental awareness and respect for local traditions and communities. Eco parks often 
highlight the importance of protecting the environment while allowing visitors to experience its beauty responsibly.</p><br>

       <p>The communities surrounding eco parks, especially in rural and indigenous areas, play a vital role in 
maintaining their natural and cultural balance. The local people serve as caretakers, guides, and storytellers,
sharing their traditions and beliefs with visitors. Many of them belong to indigenous groups who have lived in 
harmony with nature for generations. Their way of life reflects a deep respect for the land, which they see as 
acred and life-giving. They believe that every tree, river, and mountain has a spirit that must be honored and 
protected. These cultural values help sustain the eco park and remind visitors to treat the environment with 
care and humility.</p><br>

       <p>Beliefs and spiritual practices are an important part of life for these communities. Before starting any major 
activity, such as building, farming, or fishing, they often perform rituals to ask permission and blessings from the 
spirits of nature. Offerings like food, flowers, or native crafts are placed in sacred areas as a sign of gratitude 
and respect. In some eco parks, you may find prayer areas or ancestral grounds where local people continue to practice 
these customs. These traditions are passed down through storytelling, songs, and dances, ensuring that younger generations 
understand the importance of maintaining harmony with nature.</p><br>

       <p>Culture in eco park communities is also expressed through art, music, and festivals that celebrate both nature 
and heritage. Visitors can experience traditional dances that mimic the movements of birds, rivers, or wind, as well as 
songs that tell stories of the people’s connection to their land. Handicrafts made from bamboo, abaca, and other natural 
materials are sold as souvenirs, showcasing the creativity and resourcefulness of local artisans. These cultural expressions 
not only preserve tradition but also provide livelihood opportunities for families, helping sustain both the culture and the 
eco park’s environment.</p><br>

       <p>Food in eco park areas reflects the natural abundance of the surroundings. Meals are often made from locally grown crops, 
fresh vegetables, and river or lake fish. Traditional dishes may include linagpang (grilled fish soup), sinugba (grilled meat or fish), 
and laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut milk). Root crops like cassava and sweet potatoes are common staples, while fruits such as
 bananas and coconuts are used for snacks and desserts. Many eco parks also promote organic farming, encouraging the use of chemical-free 
 ingredients. Sharing meals is considered an important part of community life, symbolizing unity, hospitality, and gratitude.</p><br>

       <p>Overall, eco parks are more than just tourist destinations—they are living classrooms where people learn about the environment, 
culture, and sustainable living. They represent the connection between nature and humanity, where modern development and 
traditional beliefs can exist in harmony. The communities who live near these parks remind everyone that caring for the 
environment is not just an act of preservation but also a way of honoring the past and securing the future. Through the 
continued practice of their culture, beliefs, and food traditions, eco parks remain symbols of balance, beauty, and respect 
for the natural world.</p><br>
